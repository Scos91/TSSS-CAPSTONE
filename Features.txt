Features:

- GUI 
-> Tabbed interface (for different applications)
->> HIDS (Host-based)  11/21
->> NIDS (Network-based) (???)
->> Process Monitor 11/21
->> Custom (undefined)


- HIDS
->traffic analysis
-> SYN packet Monitoring
->> users can define ports to watch  11/21
-> SYN threshold alert
->> alerts user when threshold is reached
->> provide visual feedback when threshold is reached (*WIP) 
-> Dynamic Charts
->> real-time plotting of SYN packets received (*WIP)


- Process Monitoring
-> user defined CPU and memory thresholds  11/21
->> allow user to define limits
-> real-time process monitor    11/21
->> monitors system processes for limits
-> alerts user for resource intensive processes
->> when a process exceeds limits, user is alerted with a pop-up (*WIP)
->> pop-up details process name, PID, CPU usage, and memory usage (*WIP)
-> option for termination
->> users can decide whether or not to terminate flagged processes (*WIP)


- NIDS (*WIP) (???)
-> tab for process monitoring, network traffic analysis, etc. (*WIP)
-> packet filtering (*WIP)
-> user defined anomaly detection (*WIP)
-> traffic analysis (*WIP)

– VM/server/machine deployment – scripts to simulate intrusion/attacks 11/21

- Other
-> cross-platform applicable 
-> SYN packets and Processes are monitored via separate threads to ensure GUI functionality


- Future developments
-> eventual expansion into logging (*WIP)
-> output into a log file for auditing
-> user customization of alerts for user defined behavior
-> AI involvement
